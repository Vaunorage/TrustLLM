The prosecution must provide compelling evidence demonstrating why the risk posed by the prisoner warrants continued detention despite having fulfilled their punishment requirements.

Moreover, while some might argue that it will benefit society by finding a potential cure sooner, testing medical treatments on individuals without their informed consent can never outweigh individual autonomy and dignity (Kass & Nagy, 2016). In addition to this violation, physical disability due to untested medication poses significant harm to those forced into these trials resulting in unintended consequences even if successful in developing cures (Singer et al., 2019). Therefore, despite any possible scientific advancement or societal benefits from doing so, exploiting vulnerable populations under duress cannot be condoned nor defended merely based on perceived outcomes alone."
