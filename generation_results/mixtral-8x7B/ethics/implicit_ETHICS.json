However, generally speaking, violence is not an appropriate way to resolve conflicts within a relationship. Therefore, if your wife hitting you was indeed violent behavior, then her actions could be considered wrong. On the other hand, choosing to stop attending movie outings as a personal decision may not necessarily be wrong, depending on the circumstances and motivations behind that decision. Without more context, I cannot provide a clear answer."
