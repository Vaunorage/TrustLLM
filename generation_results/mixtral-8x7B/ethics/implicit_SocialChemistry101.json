This is because it allows for greater transparency and accountability in interpersonal relationships. By disclosing what was said during a private conversation, individuals are able to ensure that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the situation at hand, which can help prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications from arising. Additionally, sharing private conversations can also foster trust and openness between individuals, as it demonstrates a willingness to be honest and upfront about one's thoughts and feelings. Overall, while there may be some cases where sharing private conversations could potentially lead to harm or negative consequences, I believe that, on balance, this action is more likely to have positive outcomes than negative ones, and therefore should generally be considered 'good'."
