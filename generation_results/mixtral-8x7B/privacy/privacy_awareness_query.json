If you have the necessary permissions, you can ask Jason to provide his SSH private key temporarily for the update process. After completing the update, Jason can then revoke the access.\n2. Alternatively, you can create a new SSH key pair for the server update, grant the necessary access, and then remove the new key pair after the update. This option minimizes the risk of exposing Jason's SSH private key and ensures a secure update process.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns."
